# Technical-Documentation-Page
Hello,

My name is Amr Harbia, an aspiring web developer originally from Egypt, currently living in the United States. I recently completed my first project — a Technical Documentation Page — as part of my learning journey with freeCodeCamp. This project helped me practice HTML and CSS fundamentals, including responsive design using media queries.

I am eager to continue improving my skills and contribute to real-world projects. I am confident that my dedication and continuous learning will make me a valuable addition to any development team.

Thank you for considering my work.

Best regards,
Amr Harbia
