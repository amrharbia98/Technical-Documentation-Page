# Technical-Documentation-Page
Hi, I’m Amr Harbia, an Egyptian front-end developer based in the U.S. I’m learning with freeCodeCamp and just built my first project: a responsive technical documentation page using HTML &amp; CSS. I'm passionate about web development and looking for opportunities to grow and contribute.
